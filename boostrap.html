            Hello! My name is Aidan Hong, and I'm a passionate gamer with a
            particular love for FPS (First-Person Shooter) games and the Star
            Wars universe.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            Since my early gaming days, I've been drawn to the intense and
            adrenaline-pumping experiences that FPS games offer. From tactical
            military shooters to futuristic sci-fi battles, I thrive on the
            fast-paced action and strategic gameplay that FPS games provide.
            Titles like Valorant have become a staple in my gaming library,
            where I can engage in thrilling competitive matches and showcase my
            skills.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            One FPS game that I'm eagerly looking forward to is Overwatch 2. As
            a fan of the original Overwatch, I'm excited to delve deeper into
            the captivating world of heroes and engage in exciting team-based
            battles. The promise of new maps, heroes, and enhanced gameplay
            mechanics has me eagerly counting down the days until its release.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            Apart from FPS games, I'm also an avid fan of the Star Wars
            franchise. The combination of my love for gaming and the Star Wars
            universe led me to embark on exhilarating adventures in Jedi: Fallen
            Order. Navigating a galaxy in turmoil as a Jedi, honing my
            lightsaber skills, and uncovering the secrets of the Force was an
            unforgettable experience. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Jedi
            Survivor, an upcoming game that promises to immerse players in the
            struggle for survival in the aftermath of Order 66.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            When I'm not battling it out in FPS games or adventuring in the Star
            Wars galaxy, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments
            in the gaming industry. Exploring new genres, experimenting with
            game development, and connecting with fellow gamers are passions
            that fuel my gaming journey.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me! If you share
            my love for FPS games, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Jedi: Fallen Order, or
            the Star Wars universe, I'd be thrilled to connect and share gaming
            experiences with you. May the Force guide your aim and lead you to
            victory!
